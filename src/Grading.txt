Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

I loved how you printed the song title at the beginning.

Great job with your comments, too.  Well done.

There is one efficiency that could be added.  Notice that
every time you call thatLay(), you call jackHouse() immediately afterwards.
Therefore, you could add thatLay() at the end of your jackHouse() method, and
remove it from elsewhere.  Then, you could do the same thing
with thatMalt() (add thatLay() at the end of it), etc.  You could end
up with a much shorter program that way.  But the way you did it is so
well organized, with such clear structure, it's extremely well done.
